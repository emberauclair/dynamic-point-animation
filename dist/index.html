              <p>I fall asleep with my head on your chest. <br>
                I snuggle into you as we rest.<br>
                I murmur softly in your ear,<br>
                all the things you love to hear.<br>
                I whisper softly - "you warm my heart"<br>
                I squeeze you tighter - I don’t want to part. <br>
                I breathe in deep, with a shiver of joy,<br>
                You’re all I want, you’re my favorite toy. <br>
                I hug my stuffie a little tighter and fall asleep :)<br> <br>

                the allure<br>

                my eyes drop<br>
                your lips<br>
                they part<br><br>

                my cheeks redden<br>
                heart beats<br>
                red lips touch<br><br>

                I flush<br>

                A shining point, a burning fire<br>
                a pretty light casting away the night.<br>
                People look on and admire<br>
                as she runs, she glimmers bright.<br><br>

                She's wreathed in fire -<br>
                it bursts forth from every step.<br>
                Her eyes are glowing in deathly ire.<br>
                everywhere that she flees<br>

                people people pause and stare in awe-<br>
                at the girl on fire.<br>
                People learn to fear her heat,<br>
                she burns everything she touches.<br>

                People blister and they cast her out,<br>
                she runs away- her path revealed in fire.<br>
                Always lonely and destined to maim -<br>
                I'm the girl dressed in flame.<br><br>

                There’s something about you that I can’t quite place<br>
                Maybe it’s that wistful look on your face.<br>
                How do you manage to be carefree?<br>
                Maybe it’s the way you smile at me.<br>
                You reserve that smile for me alone,<br>
                It strikes a chord in my heart of stone.<br>
                Maybe it’s the way you sit over there,<br>
                Refusing a perfectly serviceable chair.<br>
                Maybe it’s the way you brighten the room,<br>
                Whenever you walk into the gloom.<br>
                Whatever it is that I can’t quite place,<br>
                It never fails to make my heart race.<br><br>

                I stare at the whiteboard, its not quite straight.<br>
                My foot begins to shake.<br>
                I stare at the whiteboard, its not quite white.<br>
                My heart races at the sight.<br>
                This whiteboard has a history,<br>
                millions of lines drawn and erased.<br>
                millions of colors interlaced.<br>
                thousands of stories taught to blank faces<br>
                It’s all blended together.<br><br>

                I hear someone rustle the pages of their book,<br>
                I turn my head to sneak a quick look.<br>
                I don’t find who made the noise,<br>
                Instead, i see a boy in restful poise.<br>
                His chin is resting on his hand,<br>
                his pen is about to descend.<br>
                His hair has fallen into his eyes,<br>
                and he lets out the smallest of sighs.<br>
                Oh! he caught me staring!<br>
                I remember that we are in class,<br>
                and turn back around with a blush.<br><br>
